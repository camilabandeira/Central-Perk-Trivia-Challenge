                        <p>Guess what? If you've ever found yourself quoting "Pivot!" in everyday situations or if the
                            thought of a meatball sub makes you inexplicably happy, you've just stumbled into your new
                            favourite spot on the internet! This isn't just any quiz; it's a love letter to "Friends,"
                            the
                            show that taught us the importance of sofas, sandwiches, and, well, friends.</p>
                        <p>Just bring your laughter, your memories, and your love for all things "Friends". It's like
                            hanging out in Monica's apartment, but instead of cleaning, we're quizzing! </p>

                        <p>So, channel your inner Unagi, grab a coffee (Gunther says hi!), and let's get this nostalgia
                            train moving.
                            Ready to find out if you're the ultimate fan? Let's kick off this quiz</p>

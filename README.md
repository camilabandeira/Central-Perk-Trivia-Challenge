<br />

1. **--dark-brown: #412C28**
   This deep, rich brown evokes the warmth and comfort of Central Perk, the coffee shop where the friends frequently gather. It's ideal for text and elements that require a strong contrast against lighter backgrounds, providing a cozy, inviting atmosphere that echoes the show's setting.

2. **--olive-brown: #5E5031**
   Olive brown complements dark brown with a hint of earthiness, reminiscent of the vintage, eclectic furniture and decor of Central Perk. This color can be used for secondary text and less prominent UI elements, adding depth and a natural feel that enhances the user interface without overwhelming it.

3. **--vivid-yellow: #FFCD1D**
   Vivid yellow mirrors the iconic frame on Monica's apartment door, bringing a burst of energy and optimism to the design. It's perfect for call-to-action buttons, highlights, and interactive elements, capturing attention and encouraging user engagement with its bright, cheerful hue.

4. **--soft-purple: #9771BF**
   Soft purple is a nod to the walls of Monica's apartment, offering a playful yet soothing contrast to the more grounded browns and yellows. It can be used for background sections, navigation bars, or to highlight categories and questions, adding a subtle touch of whimsy and familiarity for fans of the show.

5. **--light-lavender: #D0BAE7**
   Light lavender provides a gentle, airy complement to the soft purple, ideal for backgrounds, gradients, or overlay panels. It enhances the UI's visual appeal with a serene, friendly vibe, making the trivia experience more enjoyable and less straining on the eyes.

### Poppins

1. **Poppins** is chosen for its modern, clean look and excellent readability, making it perfect for the main text such as questions and answers. Its geometric, friendly design helps maintain a contemporary vibe that suits the timeless nature of "Friends."

2. ### The Bold Font

   **The Bold Font** is used for headings and key elements to grab attention with its strong and impactful presence. It resonates with the dynamic personalities of the show's characters, enhancing the quizâ€™s energy and focus.

3. ### Anonymous Pro
   **Anonymous Pro** offers great clarity for displaying user inputs and numerical data, thanks to its monospaced format. It adds a nostalgic touch with its typewriter-like appearance, nodding to the show's 1990s setting, while keeping the digital experience user-friendly.

These font choices collectively ensure a visually appealing, engaging, and easy-to-navigate user experience, reflecting the essence and era of "Friends."

- ### Wireframes

In the process of creating my wireframe, I selected Figma as the main tool because of its outstanding abilities in visualizing projects and its importance in encouraging creativity during the design phase. This decision was crucial in making the design workflow easier and improving the overall creative quality, which greatly helped the project's development stage.
